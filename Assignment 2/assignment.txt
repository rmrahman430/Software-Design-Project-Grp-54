2. The design and developmeny methodology has been consistent since our first assignment. Our initial approach of developing the formula for predicting the fuel rate based on the profile has remained the same. We've kept this structured design approach for organization within the development process. Additionally, we've remained Agile in our development methodology. Agile has been effective so far because it has allowed for us to make continuous refinement and adapt to anything that changes. Also, it has allowed us to remain collaborative and ensure that everyone has been able to keep up with their tasks.
3. We are using React Bootstrap for our frontend. They are both extremely popular frontend frameworks for website development and React Bootstrap provides React components that are pre-styled with Bootstrap's CSS. This makes it easy to integrate Bootstrap components into your React applications without having to write custom CSS. Rayyan was responsible for implementing the user login page. Edin Sehic was responsible for creating the Fuel Quote Form.
